# UsMInt
Short for User Minimalist Interface. Or maybe United States Mint. Alas, this project cannot print money.

This is a C++ UI library designed to work with Vulkan, agnostic of the program's implementation of texture handling, command buffer recording, etc. This allows for optimizations for your specific program's structuring and handling of such objects and events.
